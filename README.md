## Javascript Fundementals Challenge Three (Part Two)💪🏾

Aisha is still building her tip calculator, using the same rules as before: Tip 15% of the bill if the bill value is between 50 and 300, and if the value is different, the tip is
20%.

##### Your Task 😃:

1. Write a function `calcTip` that takes any bill value as an input and returns the corresponding tip, calculated based on the rules above. Use the function type you like the most.

###### Example

If i pass the value 275 the the function `calcTip` the function should return or console log _'The bill was 275, the tip was 41.25, and the total value 316.25'_

Good Luck 😀
